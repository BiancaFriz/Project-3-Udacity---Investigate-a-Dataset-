# Project-3-Udacity---Investigate-a-Dataset-
On this oportunity the data that we will be exploring is the "No show appointment" data which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
These are the variables incluided with their definition:

PatientID: ID of the patient that solicited the appointment
AppointmentID: ID of the appointment
Gender: The gender (M or F) of the patient
ScheduledDay:The day that the patient set up their appointment.
AppointmentDay:The day the patient actually went to the appointment.
Age: Age of the patient
Neighbourhood: indicates the location of the hospital.
Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program "Bolsa Família".
Hipertension: 1 if the patient has hipertension, 0 if not
Diabetes: 1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 if not
Alcoholism: 1 if the patient has alcoholism, 0 if not
Handcap:Can be up to 4
SMS_received: 1 if the SMS was received, 0 if not
No-show: It says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

In this data analysis we will be answering the following questions:
1) What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2) Is the welfare a good or bad incentive for people to go to their appointment?
3) What are the illness that tend to miss more their appointment
4) Does sending an SMS helps people to show up to their appointment?

### The steps followed to analyse the data are Gathering, Assesing and Cleaning in order to get to the Exploratory part, where we will be Exploring, answering questions and making the visualization of the dataset.
